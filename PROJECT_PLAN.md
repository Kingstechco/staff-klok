## ‚òÅÔ∏è DigitalOcean Architecture
- **Managed Database: PostgreSQL** (DO Managed Databases)
- **Backend/API:** 1‚Äì2 **Droplets** (Ubuntu LTS) running Docker Compose  
  - Nginx reverse proxy + Let's Encrypt (Certbot)
  - Private networking to DB via **DO VPC**
- **Admin (Next.js):**
  - Option A: **DO App Platform** (static export)  
  - Option B: Nginx on the same Droplet (if needed)
- **File Exports:** **DO Spaces** (S3-compatible) for storing/download of CSVs (optional; can stream direct)
